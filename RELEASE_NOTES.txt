Release 4.0 Alpha 3
-------------------

The third ALPHA version of HttpCore has been released. The ALPHA3 release 
includes a number of API optimizations and improvements and introduces a set 
of NIO extensions to the HttpCore API. NIO extensions can be used to build 
HTTP services intended to handle thousands of simultaneous connections with 
a small number of I/O threads.

* [HTTPCORE-15] Provided a interafce to access IP address of the local and 
  remote end points.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [ HTTPCORE-14] Scheme, SocketFactory and SecureSocketFactory moved to 
  HttpClient. Decoupled HttpHost and Scheme.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCORE-13] Refactored HttpProcessor interface and related impl classes 
  Contributed by Roland Weber <rolandw at apache.org>

* [HTTPCORE-11] Client connection interface no longer defines a specific
  method to open a connection. HTTP connections can now represent any 
  abstract I/O transport such as those based on NIO API. 
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCORE-10] Non-blocking (async) client side I/O transport based on NIO.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCORE-9] Non-blocking (async) server side I/O transport based on NIO.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCORE-7] ConnectionReuseStrategy interface changed to allow access 
  to the HTTP execution context.
  Contributed by Roland Weber <rolandw at apache.org>

* [HTTPCORE-6] Header implementation allowing for performance short-cuts 
  when serializing and deserializing HTTP headers.
  Contributed by Oleg Kalnichevski <olegk at apache.org>

* [HTTPCORE-5] Header, HeaderElement, NameValuePair, RequestLine, StatusLine, 
  HttpVersion changed to interfaces. API no longer contains any parsing and 
  formatting code and does not imply any specific physical representation of 
  HTTP messages and their elements.

Release 4.0 Alpha 2

This is a maintenance release that mostly fixes minor problems found since the 
previous release. The upstream projects are strongly encouraged use this 
release as a dependency while HttpCore undergoes another round of reviews
and optimization in the SVN trunk

Release 4.0 Alpha 1
-------------------
This release represents a complete redesign of the Jakarta Commons HttpClient
3.x API and a significant rewrite of the core HTTP components derived from 
HttpClient 3.0 code base.

These components will form the foundation of the future releases of Jakarta
HttpClient and can also be used separately to build custom client- and 
server-side HTTP services.
